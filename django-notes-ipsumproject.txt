Using the following instructions: 

http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2009/05/notes-using-pip-and-virtualenv-django/

created a virtualenv using Python 2.7 inside a directoyr named ipsum inside the customipsum folder in my home folder. 

$ virtualenv --distribute --python=/usr/bin/python2.7 ipsum-py27
  (command)   (create the env) (use this python)      (make this dir and put it in here)

renamed the directory ipsum

mv ipsum-py27 ipsum

then activated that source 

source ipsum/bin/activate

and installed Yolk

pip install yolk

and installed Django

pip install Django

after some failure notices (permission denied) tried as sudo

sudo pip install Django

apparently successful 

...but Python can't see it?

because I was typing import Django with a capital D like a dumbass.

Since I'll be creating the Django project separate from the VEnv, I rename that directory (again)

mv ipsum ipsum-ve 

...this way I know where the virtual environment is. 

Reactivate the virtual environment and create my project 

django-admin.py startproject ipsum

which creates my ipsum directory and puts the project inside it

rename the "outer" ipsum directory (outer container) for clarity

mv ipsum ipsum-cont

inside ipsum project, I edit the settings.py file, setting up sqlite3 and activating the admin function, then run syncdb to set up tables. 

moving back to ipsum-cont, I create the boilerplate for this project by running 

python manage.py startapp boilerplates

I copy the models.py over from the customipsum backup from the original project

and create the admin.py by copying it over from the original backup

I add "boilerplates" to the installed apps in settings.py for ipsum 

and run syncdb again to put the boilerplates tables in the db 

run the server again to check

looks OK
